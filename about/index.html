	<p>remembering films from the vast internet archive</p>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->
<br><br>there are countless films to be found on the internet. from various sources. forums, social media, blogs, news, etc. all can lead to a good find. you cannot submit what you find out there to this site, but you are encouraged to start your own archive. enjoy the films here, i claim no rights to any of them. some may be worthless to you, some may teach you something (rather it be about general things or the film industry) and some may stick with you forever. you'd be surprised how much films appear in our dreams. people never dreamed in black and white until photography presented the world that way.

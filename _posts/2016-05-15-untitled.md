The dew slips from the grass to her skin and soaks into her dress and hair. Her legs begin to kick up, one at a time, then slam
down into the soft earth. Dirt speckles onto her white saddle shoes and white skin. She pulls out the grass around her in chunks.
Then there's a startling scream. It feels like the cords in her throat could snap.

The screaming winds down. Her legs kick in longer and longer intervals. The grass around her is undisturbed. Even her blinking eyes
come to a close. All that's left is a soft, wheezing breath.
